### _Cloning and Initial Setup_

> Repository: https://github.com/Lo-GR/tap-room-mockup.git
1. In your terminal of choice or [GitHub's Desktop Application](https://desktop.github.com/), clone the above repository from Github. For further explanation on how to clone this repository, please visit [GitHub's Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/using-git/which-remote-url-should-i-use).
2. Ensure you are running node package manager (npm) by typing "npm -v" in your terminal. You should receive a version number back (such as 6.14.9). If NPM is not installed, visit [Node's website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and follow the installer's steps based on your OS.
3. Once you verify you are running npm, navigate in your terminal to tap-room-mockup directory. One there, run "npm install" in your terminal. 
4. You can open the code in a code editor. [VS Code is recommended](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.

## _Preplanning/Component Diagram_ üìã
```
Expectations___
1.As a user, I want to see a list/menu of all available kegs. For each keg, I want to see its name, brand, price and alcoholContent (or perhaps something like flavor for a kombucha store).
2. As a user, I want to submit a form to add a new keg to a list.
3. As a user, I want to be able to click on a keg to see its detail page.
4. As a user, I want to see how many pints are left in a keg. Hint: A full keg has roughly 124 pints.
5. As a user, I want to be able to click a button next to a keg whenever I sell a pint of it. This should decrease the number of pints left by 1. Pints should not be able to go below 0.
